title: Build a 75-inch 4K Arcade with ZimaBoard and Batocera.linux
---
>**Story:**
 There are so many nostalgic games out there, and browsing through them one by one, with their memorable names and screenshots, is like going back in time. It's like going back in time to your own childhood passions and desires (what? Your childhood desire was to watch JAV?) This tutorial will take us back to our childhood

**Read this document to learn about other ways to use ZimaBorad and get a quick overview of the diversity of ZimaBoard use**
> **Reasons to choose Batocera：**
    - > **Batocera** is one of the easiest ways to turn our ZimaBoard into an attractive retro console with multiple emulators and hundreds of games to enjoy.
    - > One of the positive points of **Batocera** is that it does not modify the internal storage memory of the ZimaBoard or other compatible device. Just remove the memory or the card we use when we do not want to use Batocera and our machine will return to its original state without any modification. A system similar to [EmuELEC](https://androidpctv.com/tutorial-emuelec-turns-your-android-tv-box-into-a-retro-console/) that we can also try.

# 1. WHAT IS [BATOCERA.LINUX](https://batocera.org/) ?

![Introduce Batocera](/images/Build-a-75-inch-4K-Arcade-with-ZimaBoard-and-Batocera/Build-a-75-4K-Arcade-with-ZimaBoard-and-Batocera-introduce-batocera.png)

**[Batocera](https://batocera.org/)software based on Debian distribution is a group of emulators that allows us to load games with their covers and other extras to play in an orderly way dozens of emulators of different machines. To play them you need the ```ROMS or ISO``` of the games and some of these systems also require the BIOS images of the machine to emulate.**

**Batocera also supports ```Android```,```PC``` ```or MacOS``` computers of all kinds, ```Raspberry Pi``` boards, many **portable retro consoles**… for which there are exclusive distributions. Batocera installation is simple, it is easy to configure, its interface is nice, easy to use and the list of supported emulators is huge.**

- Basic emulators supported: AMIGA, MSX, NES, SNES, GBA, MG, DREAMCAST, NDS, PS1, CPS1/2/3…
- Supported only on powerful hardware: PS2, PS3, GAMECUBE, 3DS, WII/U, SWITCH, XBOX…

## Making Batocera image
**To install **Batocera** we need the **IMG.GZ** file for our device, to download it we only have to enter the Batocera website and save it in our computer. Then thanks to the balenaEtcher software we will create the boot drive that will allow us to run the system without modifying our device.**

- **[Download Batocera image file IMG.GZ.](https://batocera.org/download)**
- **[Download Balena to burn the image](https://www.balena.io/etcher)**
- **[Download BIOS pack for Batocera](https://github.com/Abdess/retroarch_system/releases/download/RetroArch-v1.9.13/Batocera_V33.zip)**

## Create boot drive for Batocera

**After downloading the necessary files we can generate the ```SD memory or USB drive``` to boot this system, running the Balena program. If it does not work on our device by USB drive is recommended to use an SD card, in any case we must have the fastest possible drive if we are going to use it with this method.**

**- step1**

**We require a [microSD card or USB drive](https://amzn.to/3tcdzSh)as fast as possible, at least 16 GB and a PC card reader.**

**- step2**

**Open your Balena and click on Flash from the file and select the Batocera you have just downloaded.**

**- step3**

**Select the ```SD memory or USB drive``` you need to boot from**

**- step4**

**Enter your host password to start the conversion**

# 3.Start on ZimaBoard

## First boot on ZiamBoard

**With the ZimaBoard turned off, we insert the micro ```SD card or USB drive``` prepared with Batocera.**

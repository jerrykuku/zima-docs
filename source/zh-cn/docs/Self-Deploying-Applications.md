As described on their official website.
We are a group of like-minded enthusiasts from across the world who build and maintain the largest collection of Docker images on the web, and at our core are the principles behind Free and Open Source Software. Our primary goal is to provide easy-to-use and streamlined Docker images with clear and concise documentation.
**Yes, I think they did it!**

**Attention**
AutoFill only helps you to complete most of the configuration.
Some configuration information such as:
- the port and path of the Web UI
- the mount location of the volume or file
- the port mapping of the Host
- optional configuration items
These include but are not limited to these cases and still need to be confirmed or modified by you.
Feel free to suggest improvements to this feature in Discord Server! 

# Conclusion
The above is the Apprise API installation method, and the same is true for other applications. But note that each application itself requires some conditions.

Summarized some experiences: several parts that need to be checked in the Docker Hub interface during installation。

**For example**
- Supported Architectures
Identifies the architecture supported by the application . If not, please check the Tags above (contains the history of updated versions)
- Parameters（Highlights）
The container image is rationed using the parameters passed at runtime, and some applications have set default passwords to be displayed here as well

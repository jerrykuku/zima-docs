# Find Your CasaOS IP Address #

**When your ZimaBoard has access to CasaOS, you can use CasaOS terminal queries.**

**When your ZimaBoard is unable to access CasaOS by filling in CasaOS.local, the following two options can help you find the IP.**

## The first one: 
**Go to your router settings and look for CasaOS IP** 

{% note dinfo %}
TIPS
**Prerequisite**
- Make sure your ZimaBoard is connected to the router
- Make sure you know the router administrator password
- Make sure your computer is connected to the router or to the router's Wi-Fi network
{% endnote %}

### Now use your browser to go to your router's settings page ###

{% note dinfo %}
**TIPS**
**Common router IP addresses are**
- 192.168.0.1
- 192.168.1.254 (BT Home Hubs)
- 192.168.1.1
{% endnote %}

**In rare cases, you might need to add a colon and a port number at the end (such as 192.168.0.1:443), but most home routers won’t need this. If it goes well, you can now see your router login screen.**
**After logging in, you will be able to see your CasaOS IP.**

# The second: 
**use LanScan/Advanced IP Scanner to query IP Address**
